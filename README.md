# Iris-Flower-Species-Classification
This project is a machine learning solution to classify Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using petal and sepal measurements. It leverages supervised learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN to achieve high accuracy in species prediction.
